# Instructions to begin project
- Go back to the data_restore.py file and make the changes that I put into the script, and use the README.md to run the script.

- within scripts, there is a file `scripts.ipynb` that you can rename if you want, that you will use to code.
- you will have to select a code interpreter / kernel , for this, `YOU ONLY NEED TO CREATE AND ACTIVATE YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT`, and select that as the code interpreter.
- from there, you can start coding in python and it will output results in a clean way.

Happy Coding Vincent!
